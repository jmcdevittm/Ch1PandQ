These two scripts are what I used for data structuring, analysis, and plotting data for Ch1 of my dissertation (details added after publication).

PrecipAndQAnalysis.m is loading data, restructuring it, resampling to different temporal resolutions, and some analysis
Ch1Figs.m is plotting commands for each figure

.m format is the general file format for MATLAB (v2018a) functions or scripts.
